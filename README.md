#  E-commerce Sales Performance Analysis using sql
This project involves an in-depth analysis of a raw order details dataset using SQL. The process began with data cleaning and transformation, including handling negative profit values and renaming columns. I then executed a series of advanced queries, utilizing JOINs, GROUP BY, aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT), and window functions (RANK() OVER...) to answer key business questions, such as identifying the top-performing city in each state and analyzing sales by weekday versus weekend.
